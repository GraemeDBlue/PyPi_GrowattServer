# Reverse Engineering

The [ShinePhone/Legacy](../shinephone.md) part of this library has been reverse engineered from the [ShinePhone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.growatt.shinephones) app.

There are many ways to achieve this. One of the ways is using.
[The ShinePhone Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.growatt.shinephones)and the [NetCapture SSL application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.minhui.networkcapture) together to inspect the API calls that are made by the application and the parameters that are provided with it.

More details on how this was done can be foud [here](https://indykoning.nl/adding-growatt-solar-pannels-to-home-assistant/)
